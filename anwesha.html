    <p>Who would’ve thought that one text... one ping... would bloom into this? Anwesha, you’ve become the warmth to my mornings and the peace in my nights. I never expected love to walk in wearing a smile like yours. And yet, here we are — one year later, deeper, stronger, and more in love than I could’ve imagined.</p>

    <p>Your words felt like a lullaby written for my soul. You’ve made a place in my heart that no one else could ever touch. I might not say it every time, but I cherish you with all that I am.</p>

    <p>I promise to remember this day — our day — the one where two souls whispered across screens and hearts echoed back. I promise to take care of myself because I know now that my smile is tied to yours. And every time you feel low, remember... I’m here. Always. Just like you are for me.</p>

    <p>Every tear you wipe, every laugh you share, every hug you give, it all builds this beautiful story we’re writing together. You are my light, my home, my peace. If this world feels too heavy, let me be your reason to feel light again.</p>
